Sharkroom's based on Tensorflow.js, where the main goal is to provide a next level teaching experience between teachers and childrens specifically toddlers üë∂. In this COVID-19 pandemic, teaching on Work from Home basis has become a great mess, especially for toddlers. Here project Sharkroom comes to the rescue.

```sh
sudo apt install yarn
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Neilblaze/Sharkroom.git
cd Sharkroom
```

2. Install dependencies and prepare the build directory:

```bash
yarn
```

3. To watch files for changes, and launch a dev server:

```bash
yarn watch
```

Now you're ready to do something awesome!

## Platform support

Demos are supported on Desktop Chrome and iOS Safari.

It should also run on Chrome on Android and potentially more Android mobile browsers though support has not been tested yet.


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- Add on-screen canvas video screen-recording & screen-capturing feature. Although we have avoided that because of GDPR privacy protocols.
- Add more characters (Currently on Sharkman v1.0)
- Custom Background set feature.
- Multilanguage realtime translation support! 
- Direct interaction with Zoom, Google Meet & similar softwares.
- Creating a native Android‚Ñ¢/Flutter‚Ñ¢ app.
